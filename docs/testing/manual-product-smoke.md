## 1. Authentication

| Test | Status | Notes |

| Sign up with new email | | |
| Magic link email received | | |
| Click link → lands in app (logged in) | | |
| Refresh page → stays logged in | | |
| `/logout` → signs out | | |
| `/login` → can sign back in | | |

## 2. Basic Chat

| Message saved to history | | |
| Refresh → conversation persists | | |
| Markdown renders: **bold**, `code`, lists | | |
| Code blocks have syntax highlighting | | |
| Long responses don't break layout | | |

## 3. Knowledge & Memory

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tell Voyager a synthetic fact | | |
| New conversation → ask for that fact | | |
| Voyager remembers (semantic search working) | | |
| Tell a decision: "We decided to use Stripe" | | |
| Later ask: "What did we decide about payments?" | | |
| Voyager recalls with context | | |

**Test Phrases:**
- "Remember that our API uses REST, not GraphQL"
- "The deadline is March 15th"
- "A test collaborator prefers detailed explanations"

## 4. Agentic Retrieval (The Beating Heart)

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Vague query triggers semantic search | | |
| Exact phrase triggers keyword grep | | |
| Graph traversal finds related context | | |
| Multi-strategy chain works | | |

**Test Queries:**
- "What was that thing about pricing?" (vague → semantic)
- "Find where I said '$79'" (exact → keyword)
- "What else relates to the Stripe decision?" (graph)
- "What did we discuss yesterday?" (temporal - may not work yet)

**What to Look For:**
- Does Voyager find the RIGHT information?
- Does it chain strategies (semantic → graph → keyword)?
- Is the response grounded in your actual knowledge?
