# Native workspace boundary

The native workspace creates and selects Voyages and Fleets, splits a placement
and sets explicit dock context. Herdr Core stores the versioned layout document.
The terminal integration is an unaccepted development candidate. It does not
claim complete avatar, conversation or UX parity.

`contract/` owns the Rust request, response, identity and layout types.
`contract/build.cjs` generates declarations and strict runtime validators from
those types. Layout revisions and the allocation counter cross JavaScript as
decimal strings so a JavaScript number cannot round a Rust `u64`. Core's own
document protocol still uses its native numeric revision field. Placement,
content and optional Core terminal identities are distinct types.

`app/src/workspace.rs` applies domain changes to a proposed layout.
`app/src/client.rs` owns the current layout and revision on one worker thread.
It publishes a proposal only after Core confirms the save. Confirmed snapshots
are immutable and shared by Rust responses; a new layout proposal makes one
copy at the transaction boundary, outside rendering and input callbacks.
`app/src/core.rs`
owns the single CLI bridge to the selected dedicated session. Its framed
connection carries document RPC and terminal viewer channels together. The
terminal's start and attachment boundary is described in [terminal.md](terminal.md).

The channel holds at most eight pending calls. A client timeout reports an
unconfirmed result and never retries it. The actor keeps the accepted request
even when its caller disappears. It retains 32 request/outcome pairs without
historical layout snapshots. An identical request returns its recorded outcome
with the current confirmed snapshot, and a changed request with the same
identity is refused. A Core conflict or failed inspection marks the retained
snapshot not fresh. This is bounded in-process retention, not durable
cross-restart deduplication. New mutations must match the confirmed layout
revision. An uncertain Core result requires inspection before another change.

The `voyager_workspace` host module is installed only in the workspace chrome's
policy. A caller cannot grant itself a role through its request. The host limits
request JSON to 64 KiB before dispatching asynchronous work. Content packages
do not receive this module. Additional agent/content entry points must bind
their caller at the host boundary before reaching the same owner.

`desktop/mods/header/main.js` is retained presentation and interaction binding.
It receives confirmed snapshots and uses the generated wrapper for operations.
Switching a Voyage or Fleet changes navigation, not the explicit avatar context.
The scope controls in this checkpoint set that context; they are not the final
animated avatar interaction. Rust owns effects and GPUI draws the view. There
is no browser engine in this runtime.

The Linux native fixture drives actual mouse actions, checks the saved Core
document and captures the rendered result. An external document edit makes the
next visible action fail unchanged; an explicit Refresh obtains the new revision.
The fixture then reopens the same profile and verifies retained layout identity.
Its dedicated Core session is stopped only after the owned application quits.
Closing the current checkpoint's window closes its bridge, not the Core server.
The complete application's floating-avatar and explicit-Quit lifecycle remains
assigned to the later integration tasks.

including asynchronous host functions and retained views. The accepted native
header supplies hosting and last-good reload behavior. This checkpoint does not
claim new platform support or a measured performance improvement.
