# Plans

Implementation plans for Voyager Zero. Plans survive context compaction and provide continuity across sessions.

## How Plans Work

1. **Before implementing:** Create a plan in this directory
2. **During work:** Update the plan as decisions are made
3. **After completion:** Mark the plan as complete with outcomes
